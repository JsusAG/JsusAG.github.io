### CPSC 120

Lab 1

    Lab 1 is one of my choices since it was our first lab and showed us
    how to use and get familiar with the Linux system, the BASH shell, 
    and GitHub, all thing we will be using throughout the semester and 
    beyond. Some specifics that I found cool was configuring git and
    learning the command line commands like git push and git clone for
    example. Since this was our first assignment we had very little code
    to work on just editing the starter code to output Hello World / Hello INSERT-NAME when 
    running the code.  

Lab 2

    Lab 2, the MadLib mad was a memorable lab for me since I have done
    a similar MadLib assignment in HTML for a previous class. This was one of the more fun asignments in my opinion and helped me understand how to propperly use cout and cin, as well as how to format my code better. 
    This lab was the start of having our code formatted 

Lab 11

    Lab 11 part-1 is one of my choices since it involves object-oriented classes which was prep for the next class CPSC 121. This assignment gave me more practice when it comes to rerading files since I had struggled with that previously, as well as how read specifics like rows ///
    part 2 was a favorite because I was always curious about how the
    game Blackjack works. I was able to write functions for the first time
    that calculate the correct value of a Blackjack hand no matter how many
    Aces were dealt.
