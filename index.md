### CPSC 120

Lab 1

    Lab 1 is one of my choices since      part 2 was a favorite because I was always curious about how the
    game Blackjack works. I was able to write functions for the first time
    that calculate the correct value of a Blackjack hand no matter how many
    Aces were dealt.

Lab 2

    Lab 2, the MadLib mad was a memorable lab for me since I have done a similar
    MadLib assignment in HTML for a previous class.    part 2 was a favorite because I was always curious about how the
    game Blackjack works. I was able to write functions for the first time
    that calculate the correct value of a Blackjack hand no matter how many
    Aces were dealt.

Lab 4

    Lab 4 is one of my choices since it revolved around unit conversion     part 2 was a favorite because I was always curious about how the
    game Blackjack works. I was able to write functions for the first time
    that calculate the correct value of a Blackjack hand no matter how many
    Aces were dealt.
