# CPSC 120 Portfolio 

This is my home page! My name is Jesus Guzman and I am a student at [Cal State Fullerton](http://www.fullerton.edu/) and my major is Computer Science. I transfered to Fullerton this semester from Mt. San Antonio College

### Computer Science Projects/Labs

Lab 1

    Lab 1 is one of my choices since it was our first lab and showed us how to use and get familiar with the Linux system,
    the BASH shell, and GitHub, all things we will be using
    throughout the semester and beyond. Some specifics that I found cool was configuring
    git and learning the command line commands like git push and git clone for example.
    Since this was our first assignment we had very little code to work on, just editing
    the starter code to output Hello World / Hello INSERT-NAME when running the code.  

Lab 2

    Lab 2, the Mad libs lab was a memorable lab for me since I have done a similar Mad Libs
    lab in HTML for a previous class. It was cool to see the differences between HTML and
    C++ when completing a similar task. This was one of the more fun assignments in my
    opinion and helped me understand how to properly use cout, cin, and string. Also on
    this lab I learned about formatting my code better due to us using the 
    check_formatting tool (until we switched to use the make tool for more than just
    formatting), with this I saw that I left extra spaces all over my code frequently.

Lab 11

    Lab 11 part-1 is one of my choices since it involves object-oriented classes which
    was prep for the next class CPSC 121. In this assignment we get familiar with objects,
    in this case we use the State object. This assignment also gave me more practice 
    when it comes to reading files since I had struggled with that previously, as 
    well as how to read specifics like rows by using row.at(). In this lab we also get
    practice with naming conventions like CamelCase from class names & member functions
    (lab ex: LandArea), as well as lower_case_with_underscore_at_the_end_ from data 
    members (lab ex: land_area_).
